Literally what the title suggests. 

## Installation

Grab the files and hope it works. 

## Description

Has a couple of redeeming features, but most importantly - it kinda works. 

After being greeted by a friendly and rather unholy terminal, one will be able to query warehouse resources, products, simulate a production (with a nifty timer), order supplies, query specific products (bonus), query production (second bonus) and the best option of all - exit the program. 

It does try to adhere to the objective-oriented paradigm, however, at the time of making this program, I didn't make incessant use of it. 

Several improvements can be made, such as distributing the load across several classes (among other things), however, the base principle remains the same. JSON files simulate the warehouse states, being rewritten every time an appropriate function is called. 'Reports' are generated as .txt files, informing the user of the current warehouse loads. It also pings important stuff with an email. Lit.
